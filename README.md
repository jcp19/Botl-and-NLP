# BotL : (chat)Bot definition language 

####  and other natural language stuff...

Originally developed for `Scripting in Natural Language Processing` , this repository contains:

- a ***Named-Entity*** detection system that loads the relations between entities to a `Neo4j`graph database, in order to be able to query the text. ([link](https://github.com/jcp19/Botl-and-NLP/tree/master/named_entity))
- ***BotL*** : a language/grammar for specifying a _chatbot_ with rules for pattern detection/response, knowledge storing, timed events and questions. ([link](https://github.com/jcp19/Botl-and-NLP/tree/master/botl))
