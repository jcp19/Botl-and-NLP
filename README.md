Scripting for Natural Language Processing

TO-DO:
-> ~~ Capitalized Word Window ~~

-> ~~ Graph generation with Graphviz ~~

-> Use tools to remove normal words from being printed as names

-> Table with adjectives

-> ~~ Proper Name Window (using composed regex) ~~

-> Adjective characterization with Machine Learning

-> Tag definition (most common tags for each word) based on left window

-> Show the results in a pretty way (maybe use a webpage) and the strength of relations

Ideas:
-> Threshold for the number of relations
